  "query": "What is the DoD’s plan for infrastructure supporting AI and analytics?",
  "response": "The DoD plans to invest in abundant, flexible, secure, and jointly interoperable infrastructure that is scalable for the needs of users. This infrastructure will be federated, with some decisions and services centralized while others remain decentralized to address unique mission needs. The Department will assess infrastructure based on outcome commonality and implementation complexity, moving quickly to adopt shared services where appropriate, but keeping infrastructure decentralized for highly specialized requirements. Notably, AI-specific infrastructure is an exception to this logic. The infrastructure will adopt open standard architectures to facilitate collaborative and continuous experimentation with industry and trusted partners.",
