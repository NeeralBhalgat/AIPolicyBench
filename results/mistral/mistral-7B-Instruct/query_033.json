  "response": "The governance bodies leading AI at NASA include the Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (CAIO) and the Autonomous Systems System Capability Leadership Team (AS-SLCT). The CAIO establishes AI governance in two tiers: senior leaders guide NASA’s approach to AI, and subordinate leaders maximize AI’s value while managing risks. The AS-SLCT includes deep AI experts who share best practices for AI in mission-embedded work, such as rovers on Mars. (Source: Document 1)",
