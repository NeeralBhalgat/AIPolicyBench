  "response": "Answer: DOT’s Chief AI Officer (CAIO) prioritizes sharing custom‑developed AI code (including packages, functions, models, and model weights) that have potential for reuse by other agencies and the public “to the maximum extent possible” and, after required security review by the SR2 Committee, ensures that TrAIN‑related data, custom code, and models are shared with the public, while maintaining public rights, safety, and security.",
  "ground_truth": "Through OPEN Data workflows and Code.gov after security review.",
