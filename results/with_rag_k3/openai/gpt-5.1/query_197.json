  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response incorrectly states that all internally developed AI code must be open-sourced in public repositories, which is not necessarily true as it can be restricted. The ground truth indicates that it must be shared internally and open-sourced unless restricted, which the White Agent's response does not accurately reflect.",
