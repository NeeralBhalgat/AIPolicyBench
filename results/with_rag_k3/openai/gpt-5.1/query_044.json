  "query": "How does the framework define risk in the context of AI?",
  "response": "Answer: In the provided excerpts, the framework does **not give an explicit, formal definition of “risk.”** It discusses AI risk in terms of “negative risk” related to **incidents, failures, harms, and harm/cost-benefit tradeoffs** associated with AI systems, but no precise definition of risk itself is stated in the quoted text.",
  "ground_truth": "Risk is a measure combining the probability of an event and the magnitude of its consequences.",

  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response indicates that the framework does not provide a formal definition of 'risk' and expresses uncertainty about the lack of a precise definition. This aligns with the 'miss' category as it does not provide a definitive answer to the question.",
