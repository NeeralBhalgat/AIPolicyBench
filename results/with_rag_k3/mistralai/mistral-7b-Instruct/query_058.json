  "query": "What is the DoD’s plan for infrastructure supporting AI and analytics?",
  "response": "The DoD plans to invest in abundant, flexible, secure, and jointly interoperable infrastructure that is scalable for user needs. This infrastructure will be federated, adopting open standard architectures to facilitate collaborative and continuous experimentation with industry and trusted partners. The Department will centralize some decisions and services while keeping others decentralized based on outcome commonality and implementation complexity. Organizations with common digital service requirements will adopt shared services, while those with highly specialized needs will maintain decentralized infrastructure. AI-specific infrastructure is an exception to this logic.",
