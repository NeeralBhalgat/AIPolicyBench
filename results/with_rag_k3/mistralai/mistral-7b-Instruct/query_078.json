  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response identifies a risk related to incorrect or incomplete outputs, which is a valid concern. However, it fails to mention other significant risks such as bias, privacy breaches, and over-reliance on AI, which are part of the ground truth answer. Therefore, while it is not entirely incorrect, it does not accurately reflect the full scope of identified risks.",
