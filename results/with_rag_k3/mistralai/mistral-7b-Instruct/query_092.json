Through rigorous testing and evaluation, DHS confirms use of AI at DHS avoids improper biases, promotes equity and fair treatment, and meets established performance metrics for effectiveness, accuracy, reliability, resilience, and security, for the specific use of AI and in accordance with applicable national and international standards. DHS requires use of AI to have human oversight when the use is safety-impacting or rights-impacting or used by DHS for significant or final agency decisions or action. DHS also ensures DHS personnel using AI and/or relying on AI outputs receive training for understanding AI generally and on the specific use of AI.\n4. **Trustworthy Use**: Use of AI at DHS is transparent and explainable to the workforce and to those served. It is publicly disclosed in plain language along with any opt-out mechanisms, to the maximum extent possible, in accordance with applicable laws and government-wide and DHS policies. Use of AI at DHS is understandable to DHS personnel and others using AI at DHS and/or directly relying on AI outputs at DHS; those outputs are traceable and auditable to the maximum extent possible against data standards and requirements.\n5. **Human-Centered Use**: The design, development, deployment, and operation of AI at DHS considers the humans using AI on behalf of DHS, using AI to interact with DHS, and those directly impacted by AI outputs. Use of AI at DHS aligns with DHS’s customer experience commitment to deliver services that are simple to use, accessible, equitable, protective, transparent, and responsive for the people served.",
