  "query": "Why does NIST describe the AI RMF as a living document?",
  "response": "NIST describes the AI RMF as a living document because it is intended to be regularly reviewed and updated, with a formal review expected no later than 2028. The Framework employs a two-number versioning system to track and identify major and minor changes.",
  "ground_truth": "Because it will be regularly updated based on new technologies, community feedback, and evolving global standards.",

  "confidence": 0.7,
  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response incorrectly specifies a formal review expected no later than 2028 and mentions a two-number versioning system, which are not part of the core reasons NIST describes the AI RMF as a living document. The ground truth emphasizes regular updates based on new technologies and community feedback, which the White Agent's response does not address.",
