The other goals (AI Strategic Goals 2 through 5) are described as supporting preparatory activities for achieving Goal 1, but their specific details are not provided in the text.",

  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response incorrectly states that the specific five strategic goals are not provided, while the ground truth clearly lists them. The response misrepresents the information by suggesting that only one goal is known and that the others support it, which is not accurate.",
