  "query": "How will vendors and procurement be handled?",
  "response": "Vendors and procurement will be handled by working with vendors to protect USDA data, especially PII, and proactively addressing impacts related to ethics, integrity, and bias. Procurement staff will incorporate standardized contract language in service and supply contracts to uphold USDA AI policies. Additionally, a process will be created to review Generative AI in commercial software, and contracting officers will be educated on industry developments in AI to assist with holistic AI contract reviews. For GSA-funded procurements, market research will determine if AI is offered as a solution, and acquisition teams must coordinate with the CAIO and AI Safety Team before proceeding. Requirements documents for AI procurements must be approved by the CAIO.",
  "ground_truth": "Standard contract language on data rights/usage/privacy; disclose GenAI in products; monitor for “shadow AI”; prefer secure, compliant tools.",

  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response includes details about handling vendors and procurement related to USDA data and AI policies, but it does not align with the ground truth answer, which emphasizes standard contract language on data rights and monitoring for 'shadow AI'. The response introduces additional processes and roles that are not mentioned in the ground truth, indicating a deviation from factual accuracy.",
