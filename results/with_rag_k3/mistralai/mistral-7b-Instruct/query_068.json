  "query": "How does DOE promote sharing of AI-related software and code?",
  "response": "DOE promotes sharing of AI-related software and code through DOE CODE, a public software services platform and search tool for software and code resulting from DOE-funded research. This platform allows for collaboration, archiving, and discovery of scientific and business software funded by DOE. Additionally, DOE CODE offers a GitLab instance for internal sharing within the Department, enabling registered users to create and import repositories for controlled access or collaboration. DOE also promotes code sharing through the Visual Intellectual Property Search (VIPS) database, which includes open-source code for accessing models and AI assets, and through several AI working groups.",
