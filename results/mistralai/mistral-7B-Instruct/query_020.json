  "query": "What sharing and inventory requirements promote reuse and transparency?",
  "response": "Agencies must proactively share their custom-developed code, including models and model weights, across the Federal Government for AI applications in active use, except in restricted circumstances. They should also prioritize sharing AI code, models, and data government-wide, consistent with the OPEN Government Data Act, and release and maintain AI code as open source software in a public repository where practicable. Additionally, agencies should identify and share commonly used packages or functions with the greatest potential for reuse by other agencies or the public. (Documents 2, 3, 4)",
  "ground_truth": "Share custom AI code/models government-wide (and open source where practicable) and publish an annual AI use case inventory.",

  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response accurately reflects the ground truth by emphasizing the importance of sharing custom AI code and models government-wide, as well as the open-source aspect where practicable. It also aligns with the requirement to promote reuse and transparency, although it does not explicitly mention the annual AI use case inventory, which is a minor omission.",
