  "confidence": 0.8,
  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response incorrectly expands on the definition of TrAIN by introducing terms like 'Transportation AI-enabled Network' and details about 'risk management monitoring' that are not part of the ground truth answer. The core concept of TrAIN as an AI-enabled network for developing, testing, and deploying operational AI solutions is present, but the additional details are misleading.",
