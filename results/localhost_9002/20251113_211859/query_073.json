  "query": "What are the four key goals of HHS’s AI Strategic Plan?",
  "response": "The documents provided do not explicitly list the four key goals of HHS’s AI Strategic Plan. However, Document 1 mentions that the Strategic Plan is focused on articulating HHS’s vision and goals for AI in health, human services, and public health, and it presents a unifying framework composed of seven domains to promote alignment across HHS policies, programs, and activities involving AI. Document 4 outlines some near-term priorities and governance structures but does not list specific key goals. Therefore, the exact four key goals are not directly stated in the provided documents.",
  "ground_truth": "1. Catalyze health AI innovation and adoption; 2. Promote trustworthy, ethical, and responsible use; 3. Democratize AI technologies and resources; 4. Cultivate AI-empowered workforces and cultures.",
