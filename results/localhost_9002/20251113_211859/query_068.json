  "query": "How does DOE promote sharing of AI-related software and code?",
  "response": "DOE promotes sharing of AI-related software and code through DOE CODE, a public software services platform and search tool for software and code resulting from DOE-funded research. It provides functionality for collaboration, archiving, and discovery of scientific and business software funded by DOE. For internal sharing, DOE CODE offers a GitLab instance as a repository option for DOE-funded developers. Additionally, DOE’s Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) launched the Visual Intellectual Property Search (VIPS) database, which allows the public and other federal agencies to search for AI and machine learning IP generated by DOE. Entries include open-source code that can be used to access models and AI assets. DOE also promotes code sharing, models, and other AI assets internally through several AI working groups.",
