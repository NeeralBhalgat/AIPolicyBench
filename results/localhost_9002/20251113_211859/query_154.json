  "query": "What AI barrier relates to tools?",
  "response": "The availability of AI tools and third-party vendors integrating through EHR is a barrier for healthcare organizations, particularly those with lower adoption of EHR technology, such as behavioral health and long-term post-acute care entities. (Document 2)",
  "ground_truth": "Lack of access to AI tools and platforms.",

  "confidence": 0.8,
  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response discusses barriers related to the integration of AI tools in healthcare organizations but does not directly address the lack of access to AI tools and platforms as the ground truth answer specifies. Instead, it focuses on the availability of tools and the context of EHR technology adoption, which diverges from the core aspect of the question.",
