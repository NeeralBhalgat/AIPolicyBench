  "response": "The framework does not explicitly define \"risk\" in the context of AI within the provided documents. However, it emphasizes managing AI risks to minimize potential negative impacts, such as threats to civil liberties and rights, while maximizing positive impacts (Document 5). It also highlights the importance of defining reasonable risk tolerance and using the framework to manage and document risk management processes (Documents 1 and 3).",
