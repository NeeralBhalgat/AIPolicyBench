  "query": "What internal improvements might AI support in NRC processes?",
  "response": "AI might support internal improvements in NRC processes by increasing staff knowledge and experience for future regulatory reviews and oversight through the use of AI tools. This is achieved by developing and pursuing use cases to build technical expertise for reviewing the use of AI in NRC-regulated activities, creating an ecosystem that supports data science, assessment and integration of emerging AI tools, and hands-on talent development (Document 5). Additionally, the NRC will leverage its experience reviewing relevant historical models and lessons learned from previous new technology applications to inform the development of the AI framework (Document 1, Document 3).",
