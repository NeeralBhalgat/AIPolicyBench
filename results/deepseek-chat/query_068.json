  "query": "How does DOE promote sharing of AI-related software and code?",
  "response": "DOE promotes the sharing of AI-related software and code through DOE CODE, a public software services platform and search tool for software and code resulting from DOE-funded research. DOE National Laboratories, facilities, and contractors are required to announce their software using DOE CODE. For internal sharing within the Department, DOE CODE offers a GitLab instance as a repository option for DOE-funded developers. Additionally, DOE's Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) launched the Visual Intellectual Property Search database, known as VIPS, which includes open-source code that can be used to access models and AI assets. Furthermore, DOE promotes code sharing, models, and other AI assets internally through several AI working groups.",
