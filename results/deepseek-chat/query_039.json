  "query": "How will vendors and procurement be handled?",
  "response": "Vendors and procurement will be handled by working with them to protect USDA data, especially PII, and proactively addressing impacts related to ethics, integrity, and bias (Document 1). Procurement teams must coordinate with the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) and the AI Safety Team for AI-related acquisitions, ensuring requirements documents are approved by the CAIO (Document 2). Contractual terms should prioritize continuous improvement, performance monitoring, and evaluation of procured AI (Document 4).",
  "ground_truth": "Standard contract language on data rights/usage/privacy; disclose GenAI in products; monitor for “shadow AI”; prefer secure, compliant tools.",

  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response discusses handling vendors and procurement in relation to USDA data protection and AI-related acquisitions, but it does not align with the ground truth answer, which emphasizes standard contract language on data rights and privacy, and monitoring for 'shadow AI'. The response introduces concepts not present in the ground truth, indicating a factual inaccuracy.",
