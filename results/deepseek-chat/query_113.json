  "query": "How does DOT protect AI systems from cybersecurity risks?",
  "response": "Based on the provided documents, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is taking several steps to protect AI systems from cybersecurity risks. These steps include:\n\n1. Releasing HPH Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) to help organizations prioritize the implementation of high-impact cybersecurity practices.\n2. Proposing measures to strengthen cybersecurity in healthcare under HIPAA, requiring better protection of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) against both external and internal threats.\n3. Collaborating with government partners to develop and share draft guidelines on essential cybersecurity practices to protect AI models.\n4. Developing guidelines on maintaining operations after a system deploying AI is compromised, including having policies, tools, and training in place to understand when AI systems are producing incorrect outputs and resiliency plans for when AI systems are compromised.\n5. Updating existing regulations and guidelines on adoption to include best practices for maintaining cybersecurity, including for maintaining secure means of data transfer and sharing.",
