See IRC § 7803(a)(3); Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer; and www.irs.gov/taxpayer-bill-of-rights. IRS employees are responsible for being familiar with and acting in accordance with these rights. IRS use of AI must not violate these rights. (Document 1)",

  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response discusses taxpayer rights and the Internal Revenue Code but does not mention the specific law that protects taxpayer information, which is IRC § 6103.
