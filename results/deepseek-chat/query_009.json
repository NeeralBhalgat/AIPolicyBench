  "query": "What research priorities will make AI safer for high-stakes use?",
  "response": "The documents do not provide specific research priorities that will make AI safer for high-stakes use. However, they do suggest that research on AI interpretability, AI control systems, and adversarial robustness is important (Document 2). Additionally, there's a focus on exploring approaches to protect AI models and sensitive health data from adversarial attacks, developing mechanisms to prevent and reduce harm from the misuse of predictive analytics tools, and providing guidelines on training models on sensitive health data (Document 4).",
