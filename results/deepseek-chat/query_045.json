  "query": "What challenge does the AI RMF highlight about measuring AI risk?",
  "response": "The AI RMF highlights the challenge of measuring AI risk, specifically in terms of the complexity and need for continuous improvement in risk measurement methods. This is mentioned under the challenge of \"Risk Measurement\" in Document 4, where it is stated that \"Risk Measurement\" is one of the challenges for AI Risk Management.",
  "ground_truth": "AI risks are difficult to measure because they are not well-defined, may emerge unexpectedly, and depend on complex real-world conditions.",
  "evaluation_result": "hallucination",

  "confidence": 0.7,
  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response mentions the complexity and need for continuous improvement in risk measurement methods, but it does not accurately capture the essence of the challenge as described in the ground truth, which emphasizes the undefined nature of AI risks and their dependence on complex real-world conditions.",
