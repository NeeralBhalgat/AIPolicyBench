  "query": "What must agencies do regarding AI risk management?",
  "response": "Agencies must adhere to the risk management practices required in M-24-10 Section 5, issue guidance for safety and rights impacting AI, document and validate the implementation of these practices, integrate AI risk into their Enterprise Risk Management program, manage AI risk through established protocols at all appropriate levels, and periodically review AI risk by a senior level risk management council. Additionally, they should connect technical aspects of AI system design and development to organizational values and principles, address full product lifecycle and associated processes, and ensure strong governance for effective AI risk management over an AI system’s lifespan and the organization’s hierarchy. They should also prioritize risk management efforts based on the assessed risk level and potential impact of an AI system.",
