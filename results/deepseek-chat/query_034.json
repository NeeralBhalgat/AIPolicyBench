  "query": "How will oversight balance innovation vs risk?",
  "response": "The documents suggest that oversight will balance innovation and risk by adopting a risk-based approach to AI governance. This approach encourages high-impact use cases and supports compliant AI adoption while clarifying expectations for AI development and deployment. Risk management efforts will prioritize resources based on the assessed risk level and potential impact of an AI system, and organizations will define reasonable risk tolerance where established guidelines do not exist (Document 4). Additionally, the Department of Justice will determine whether an AI use complies with minimum requirements and will inform but not displace department-wide AI governance (Document 5).",
