  "query": "How does DOT handle sharing AI models and code with the public?",
  "response": "The Department of Transportation (DOT) handles sharing AI models and code with the public by prioritizing the sharing of custom-developed code, including models and model weights, to the maximum extent possible in compliance with M-24-10 Section 4(d)(i). The Custom AI Office (CAIO) will ensure that TrAIN-related data, custom code, and models that clear the SR2 Committee’s security review are shared with the public. The CAIO will maintain use case security review justification, documentation, and sharing methodologies in TrUCKR.",

  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response provides specific details about the DOT's processes and offices that are not corroborated by the ground truth answer, which simply states that sharing occurs through OPEN Data workflows and Code.gov after security review. The details about the Custom AI Office and the SR2 Committee appear to be fabricated or misrepresented.",
