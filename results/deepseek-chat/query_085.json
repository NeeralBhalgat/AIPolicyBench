  "query": "What is required for AI systems that are safety- or rights-impacting?",
  "response": "AI systems that are safety- or rights-impacting must comply with additional minimum requirements due to the potential risks they pose, such as discrimination and other harms to people. These requirements include transparent governance and compliance processes, and system owners are responsible for enacting these minimum requirements. Waivers from these practices may be requested and must be adjudicated by the CAIO and AI Governing Board. Any non-compliant covered AI must cease operations by December 1, 2024, until it becomes compliant with the specified controls (Document 1).",
  "ground_truth": "They must have human oversight and undergo rigorous testing and evaluation for bias, effectiveness, and reliability.",

  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response includes some relevant points about governance and compliance but does not accurately reflect the ground truth answer, which emphasizes the need for human oversight and rigorous testing for bias, effectiveness, and reliability. The details provided about waivers and deadlines are not standard requirements for safety- or rights-impacting AI systems.",
