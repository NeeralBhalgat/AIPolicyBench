  "query": "How does DOT ensure AI training data are trustworthy?",
  "response": "DOT ensures AI training data are trustworthy by promoting the use of large, high-quality, and representative datasets, evaluating the data for accuracy, completeness, and representativeness, and ensuring that the data used to validate an AI system is separate from the data used to build the system. This is mentioned in Document 3, which states: \"FSSPs should ensure that the data used to validate an AI system is separate from the data used to build the system. Reuse of training data in testing can lead to misunderstanding of the system’s performance and biases.\" Additionally, Document 5 highlights the importance of data quality, management, and oversight to prevent AI from behaving in undesirable ways.",
  "ground_truth": "By assessing datasets for quality, accuracy, representativeness, and bias.",
