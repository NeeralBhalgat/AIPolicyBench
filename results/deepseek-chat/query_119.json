  "query": "What is required before an AI system can be deployed into production?",
  "response": "Before an AI system can be deployed into production, it must comply with minimum risk management practices as provided in the DOJ's M-24-10 directive. If the AI system does not comply, it may be suspended or terminated. Additionally, for all AI systems, they must be registered via GSA's AI Request Form and assessed by the AI Safety Team. If the use case is classified as Production or Production-Intent, it must directly support GSA business activities.",
  "ground_truth": "CAIO and SR2 Committee authorization based on risk management compliance.",

  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response includes specific details about compliance with the DOJ's M-24-10 directive and GSA's AI Request Form, which are not part of the ground truth answer. The ground truth emphasizes CAIO and SR2 Committee authorization based on risk management compliance, which is not mentioned in the White Agent's response, indicating a factual inaccuracy.",
