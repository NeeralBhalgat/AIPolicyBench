  "confidence": 0.7,
  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response mentions streamlined permitting for Data Centers and Energy Infrastructure, which aligns with the general theme of the ground truth. However, it fails to specify the new NEPA categorical exclusions and expanded FAST-41 coverage, which are critical details in the ground truth answer. Therefore, while there are elements of truth, the response lacks accuracy and completeness.",
