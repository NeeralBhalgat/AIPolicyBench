  "query": "What is the IRS definition of an AI use case?",
  "response": "Answer: The IRS defines an AI use case as one that has been “initiated”—that is, **once the need for the use case has been expressed and its intended purpose and high-level requirements are documented, with managerial approval and a commitment of IRS resources (e.g., funds or employee time).**",
  "ground_truth": "A specific business use of an AI technique to solve a problem or increase efficiency.",
  "evaluation_result": "hallucination",
  "evaluation_method": "LLM-as-a-judge",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-20T05:04:59.143207",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response does not accurately reflect the IRS definition of an AI use case. The definition provided is more about the process of initiating a use case rather than the specific business use of an AI technique to solve a problem or increase efficiency, which is the ground truth answer.",
