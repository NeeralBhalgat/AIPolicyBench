  "query": "What challenge does the AI RMF highlight about measuring AI risk?",
  "response": "Answer: The AI RMF highlights that measuring AI risk is challenged by the lack of sufficient studies and data on “the frequency and rationale with which humans overrule AI system output in deployed systems,” which “may be useful to collect and analyze.”",
  "ground_truth": "AI risks are difficult to measure because they are not well-defined, may emerge unexpectedly, and depend on complex real-world conditions.",
  "evaluation_result": "hallucination",
  "evaluation_method": "LLM-as-a-judge",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-20T04:55:12.943969",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response incorrectly focuses on the lack of studies regarding human overruling of AI outputs, which is not the primary challenge highlighted by the AI RMF. The ground truth emphasizes that AI risks are poorly defined and depend on complex conditions, which the White Agent's response does not address.",
