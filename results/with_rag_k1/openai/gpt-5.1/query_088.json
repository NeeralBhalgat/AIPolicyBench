  "query": "How does DHS ensure transparency and accountability in its AI use?",
  "response": "Answer: DHS ensures transparency and accountability in its AI use by:\n\n- Maintaining organizational practices and governing structures for harm reduction, such as risk management, to support more accountable systems.  \n- Considering the impact of transparency and accountability measures on the implementing entity, including resource needs and protection of proprietary information.  \n- Maintaining the provenance of training data and supporting attribution of AI system decisions to subsets of that training data.  \n- Testing different types of transparency tools and related documentation, in cooperation with AI deployers, to ensure AI systems are used as intended.",
