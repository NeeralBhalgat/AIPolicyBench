  "response": "The DOT shares AI models and code with the public by ensuring that TrAIN-related data, custom code, and models that pass the SR2 Committee’s security review are shared, and the CAIO maintains the justification, documentation, and sharing methods in TrUCKR.",
  "ground_truth": "Through OPEN Data workflows and Code.gov after security review.",

  "confidence": 0.7,
  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response includes specific terms and processes (TrAIN, SR2 Committee, TrUCKR) that do not align with the ground truth answer, which mentions OPEN Data workflows and Code.gov. This indicates a misunderstanding or fabrication of the actual processes used by DOT.",
