  "query": "How will advanced AI compute export controls be enforced?",
  "response": "Advanced AI compute export controls will be enforced by leveraging new and existing location verification features on the chips to ensure they are not in countries of concern, and by establishing a new effort led by the Department of Commerce (DOC) to collaborate with intelligence community (IC) officials on global chip export control enforcement. This includes monitoring emerging technology developments in AI compute to ensure full coverage of possible countries or regions where chips are being diverted, and expanding end-use monitoring in high-risk countries, especially where there is no Bureau of Industry and Security Export Control Officer present.",
  "ground_truth": "Use location verification and enhanced monitoring to prevent diversion to countries of concern.",
