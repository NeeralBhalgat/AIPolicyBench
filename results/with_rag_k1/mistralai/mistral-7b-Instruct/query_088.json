  "query": "How does DHS ensure transparency and accountability in its AI use?",
  "response": "DHS ensures transparency and accountability in its AI use by proportionally and proactively adjusting their transparency and accountability practices. Maintaining organizational practices and governing structures for harm reduction, like risk management, can help lead to more accountable systems. Measures to enhance transparency and accountability should also consider the impact of these efforts on the implementing entity, including the level of necessary resources and the need to safeguard proprietary information. Maintaining the provenance of training data and supporting attribution of the AI system’s decisions to subsets of training data can assist with both transparency and accountability.",
