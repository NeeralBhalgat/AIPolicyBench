  "query": "What minimum risk practice deadline applies to high-impact AI, and what if AI is non-compliant?",
  "response": "If a particular high-impact use case is not compliant with the minimum practices, the agency must safely discontinue use of the AI functionality.",
  "ground_truth": "Implement minimum practices within 365 days; discontinue use if not compliant.",

  "confidence": 0.8,
  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response does not mention the specific deadline of 365 days for implementing minimum practices, which is a critical part of the ground truth. While it correctly states that non-compliance would lead to discontinuation of use, the omission of the deadline makes the response factually incomplete.",
