  "response": "Data is readied for AI by treating it as a product, managed by data domain owners and data product teams. Data products are designed, built, and maintained with user needs in mind, ensuring proper management, governance, accountability, quality, and access controls. This approach stimulates data sharing, breaks down silos, and promotes collaboration, improving data quality, reducing backlogs and redundancy, and enabling effective, data-driven decision-making.",
