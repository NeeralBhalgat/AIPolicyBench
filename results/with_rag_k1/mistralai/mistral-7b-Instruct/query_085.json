  "query": "What is required for AI systems that are safety- or rights-impacting?",
  "response": "AI systems that are safety- or rights-impacting must comply with additional minimum requirements due to potential risks such as discrimination and other harms to people.

Waivers from these requirements may be requested from the CAIO and AI Governing Board.",

  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response includes details about compliance and operational deadlines that are not part of the ground truth answer.
