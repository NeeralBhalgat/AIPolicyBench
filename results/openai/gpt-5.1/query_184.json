  "query": "What must agencies do regarding AI risk management?",
  "response": "Agencies must ensure that:\n\n- “all safety and or rights impacting AI must adhere to the risk management practices required in M‑24‑10 Section 5.”  \n- “AI risk has been identified as a mandatory element in the Department’s approach to Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, and – as such – will be integrated into Interior’s risk register.”  \n- “AI risk will be managed through established protocols and at all appropriate levels within the Department and periodically reviewed by a senior level risk management council,” which will ensure AI risks “are known, quantified, reduced to acceptable levels, and prioritized in decision-making.”",
  "ground_truth": "Measure, monitor, evaluate, and report on AI activities, including regular risk assessments.",
