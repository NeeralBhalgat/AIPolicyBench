  "query": "How does DOE promote sharing of AI-related software and code?",
  "response": "DOE promotes sharing of AI-related software and code by using DOE CODE, “a public software services platform and search tool for software and code resulting from DOE-funded research,” and requiring that “all DOE National Laboratories, facilities, and contractors…announce their software using DOE CODE.” For internal sharing, “DOE CODE offers a GitLab instance as a repository option for DOE-funded developers.” In addition, through the Visual Intellectual Property Search (VIPS) database, “members of the public and other federal agencies can search for AI and machine learning IP generated by DOE. Entries include open-source code,” and DOE “promotes code sharing, models, and other AI assets internally through several AI working groups.”",
  "ground_truth": "Through DOE CODE, a platform for collaboration, archiving, and discovery of DOE-funded AI and software projects.",
