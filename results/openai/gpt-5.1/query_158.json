  "query": "How is NASA addressing generative AI risks?",
  "response": "NASA is addressing generative AI risks by:\n\n- Treating “quality control issues with generative AI outputs” as a key barrier and “augment[ing] standard engineering, system engineering processes, and software engineering with additional AI considerations.”  \n- Strongly emphasizing “human verification and validation, as well as science evaluation and benchmarks, … especially with generative AI.”  \n- Issuing initial generative AI use guidance (May 2023) and having the CAIO oversee an update to this guidance in Fall 2024, with the CAIO “postured to issue interim policy memorandums to address concerns and mitigate risk.”",
