  "query": "What must project teams do when retraining a model?",
  "response": "Answer: When retraining a model, project teams must **update and resubmit the Model Card and Datasheet artifacts before beginning operational use**, whenever the use case “changes in a way that meaningfully affects the accuracy of the current artifacts.”",
  "ground_truth": "Update the Model Card and Datasheet.",
  "evaluation_result": "correct",

  "confidence": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "The White Agent's response accurately states that project teams must update the Model Card and Datasheet when retraining a model, which aligns with the ground truth answer. The additional detail about operational use and changes affecting accuracy is relevant but not necessary for the core requirement.",
